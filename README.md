## Lynk

Lynk is a minimal, privacy-focused app that makes it easy to save and share text and URLs. Whether you're collecting notes, saving important links, or quickly sharing something with a friend, we keep everything in your iCloud.

📎 Save and organize text or URLs

🔐 Everything stays on your iCloud

⏰ Get reminded to get back to that article you set for later

🚫 No accounts, no tracking, no ads

⚡️ Fast, clean, and distraction-free

Your links. Your notes. Your privacy.
That’s Lynk.

### Code

This Project will be open source and available to the public.

> I'm still working on the refactoring to make sure it is good to share with everyone
