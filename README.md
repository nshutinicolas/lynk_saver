## Lynk

Lynk is a minimal, privacy-focused app that makes it easy to save and share text and URLs. Whether you're collecting notes, saving important links, or quickly sharing something with a friend, Lynk keeps everything local and secure — nothing leaves your device.

📎 Save and organize text or URLs

🔐 Everything stays on your device

🚫 No accounts, no tracking, no ads

⚡️ Fast, clean, and distraction-free

Your links. Your notes. Your privacy.
That’s Lynk.

### Code

This Project will be open source and available to the public. I'm still working on the refactoering to make sure it is good to share with everyone
